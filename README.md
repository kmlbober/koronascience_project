## About

This project was created in March 2020 as a part of the Warsaw University of Technology STEAM course _Data Science with Python. Data Analysis of COVID-19 Cases_.

The purpose of this project was a statistics analysis of the hypothesis repeated in the media about the influence of temperature on the spread of the coronavirus. And also visualization of the state of COVID-19 spread at the start of pandemic in Poland, in comparison to other countries. 

Data sources: 
* [World Weather Online API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/)
* [List of Countries and Capitals](http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals)
* [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset-/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases) - COVID-19 data

## Findings

1) Visualization of total cases of coronavirus in the world from 22/01/2020 till 30/03/2020.

5) Visualization of the relationship between the average temperature in the last 30 days and number of cases.

As you can see, in the countries with the number of cases over 10 000, an average temperature varies between 5째C and 15째C. In countries with an average temperature below -5째C, there were no cases of infections, while above 20째C the number of infections is insignificant.
